***prologue***

Like many of you have, I have many different experiences in my life.

I was a Soldier.

I was a dog trainer. (I have a dog trainer license)

I was a pianist (played piano for more than 10 years received some awards)

I was a golf player

Also I was a sales representative.

Most of these things still remained as my hobby now. But I was fully engaged in each of these things to make it as my job once.

I think I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I look back at the moments in my life.

***the story***

I am from South Korea. Parents in South Korea have very very extremely high passion for education. 

I think I lived my life as my parents told me when I was young. In consequence of that, I couldn’t find what I like to be, etc. 


I can’t say every details in here but I just started to study different thing again after we immigrated to US.

I received my degree from University of Minnesota. I have a successful record of my academic achievements majoring 

sustainable systems management.  Yes it’s totally different field again.

After graduated University, I worked as Sales rep. in medical and automobile field since my major was related to business 

and management.

When I worked as a sales rep, I thought I enjoyed it. But it never made me satisfied.  

I was always thinking about my job  at that time.  It’s just not the job I could do forever in rest of my life. 

And there were very limited fields I can work for.  While I am thinking of all of these things, one friend of mine told me 

often how he felt about his job. He was desktop supporter; he was quality assurance.  And Now he is working as software 

engineer at insurance company.

After talked to him more than few months about my career change.  I have decided to go to bootcamp. 

I know it is really big challenge and it is not going to be easy. 

but I am really happy when I feel learning and how it can be more creative. This field is incredibly broad. 

I am thinking this as my last chance in my life. I quit my job to go to bootcamp. And here I am.

I don’t have a place to go back. I will make my dream come true.
